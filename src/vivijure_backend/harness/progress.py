"""Structured progress channel for a render: discrete stage events, best-effort, never fatal.

The design fork, decided: **option B (an R2 structured channel) is primary.** The worker already
holds the R2 store and its token, so this adds no new infra and no new secret; it is durable and
queryable after the fact, reusable beyond RunPod, and it matches the @event structured-state
philosophy (machine state alongside the human stdout). **Option A (RunPod's progress_update) is
supported as an optional injected hook**, so a single `emit()` yields human stdout, R2 machine
state, AND the RunPod status field at once.

Per render the worker writes two objects, keyed by project AND job id so concurrent or cancelled
runs never clobber each other (we have had three in flight at once):
  - `renders/<project>/progress/<job_id>.ndjson` : the event stream, one JSON object per line.
    The worker owns the job, so it accumulates events in memory and rewrites the whole (tiny) log
    each emit, no S3 append needed and no second writer to race.
  - `renders/<project>/progress/<job_id>.json`   : the latest snapshot (status, counts, last
    event, error), the cheap thing a `/status/<project>/<job_id>` route or Uptime Kuma polls.

Events are discrete stages, not stdout scraping: `started`, `mirror_done`, `train_done{slot}`,
`keyframe_done{shot}`, `i2v_done{shot}`, `assemble_done`, `upload_done{key}`, `complete`, and
`error{stage}`; plus a throttled `train_step{slot,step,total,loss}` (training is the long pole,
so it is the one place we report sub-stage progress, and only every N steps).

EVERYTHING is best-effort: every R2 write, every stdout line, every hook call is wrapped so a
logging failure is swallowed and can never propagate into the render. We just spent four builds
clearing real crashes; a logging-induced one is not allowed.
